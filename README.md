Discussion of the video is in the description itself.

Issues:
1. So far, I can't get multiplayer to work in the build mode, however if you compile the code and run it through the editor, it works.
2. I tried getting health to work but for some reason it wouldn't replicate properly, so I've removed the bit of code. Health decay still exists in the GameMode C++ class
3. Messages also wouldn't replicate properly and I'm not entirely sure why either.
